# ycsbWorkload
# YCSB workload.  Valid values are a-f. Each letter determines a different
# mix of read and update workload percentage generated. a= 50/50, b=95/5,
# c=100 read. Refer to YCSB documentation for more detail

ycsbNoOfIterations: 0

# ycsbOpsPerIteration

# This value controls the number of SQL operations performed in each benchmark
# iteration. Increasing this value increases the run-time of each iteration,
# and also reduces the frequency at which new connections are made during the
# sample workload run period.
